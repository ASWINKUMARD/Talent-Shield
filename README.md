# 💼 Talent-Shield

# 🧠 Project Overview

- Predict which employees are likely to leave a company using LightGBM, a fast and efficient gradient boosting algorithm.
- This project helps HR teams identify high-risk employees and take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce turnover.

# 📂 Dataset

- Source: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)

- Features: Age, JobRole, Department, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, YearsAtCompany, etc.

- Target: Attrition (Yes = 1, No = 0)

# Dataset Size: 1,470 employees

# 🛠️ Implementation Steps

1️⃣ Load the dataset and inspect it for missing values

2️⃣ Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder

3️⃣ Split data into train and test sets

4️⃣ Train LightGBM Classifier with early stopping

5️⃣ Tune hyperparameters like num_leaves, max_depth, learning_rate, and n_estimators

6️⃣ Make predictions and evaluate models:

# Accuracy ✅

# Precision, Recall, F1-Score 📊

# ROC-AUC 🔹

7️⃣ Visualize feature importance to identify key drivers of attrition

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy

- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

- Confusion Matrix

- ROC-AUC Score

# LightGBM efficiently handles both numeric and categorical features, producing fast and accurate predictions.
